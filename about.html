      <h1>About Fur & Away Glasgow</h1>

      <!-- Our Story -->
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Michael MacKenzie, and I founded Fur & Away Glasgow in 2024 out of a lifelong passion for animals.  
        Growing up in the Scottish Highlands, I spent my days helping on local farms—hand-feeding lambs and  
        caring for any stray creatures that crossed my path. At home, I was kept busy with my Labrador, Harley,  
        two cats (Eve and Topcat), and my rabbit, Fluffy. Each one taught me that every animal deserves a  
        safe, nurturing environment where they can truly thrive.
      </p>

      <!-- Mission & Values -->
      <h2>Our Mission and Values</h2>
      <p>
        At Fur & Away Glasgow, we believe in positive reinforcement and treating every pet as part of our family.  
        From cosy boarding suites to our fun-filled daycare, every service is designed with your pet’s wellbeing in mind.  
        We also love giving back to our community—ten percent of our profits go to Scottish animal charities,  
        supporting rescue organisations and community programmes that make a real difference.
      </p>

      <!-- Meet the Team -->
      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <p>
        We’re fortunate to have a small but growing dedicated group of carers who bring compassion, energy, and years of expertise  
        in animal care, training, and enrichment.

          Hannah is currently working towards an advanced qualification in animal care. She’s always researching new  
          methods to help pets feel at home, whether it’s through soft music during nap time or extra cuddles for  
          anxious newcomers.
