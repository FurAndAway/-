      <h1>About Fur & Away Glasgow</h1>

      <!-- Our Story -->
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Michael MacKenzie</strong>, and I founded Fur & Away Glasgow in
        <strong>2024</strong> out of a lifelong passion for animals. Growing up in
        the Scottish Highlands, I spent my days helping on local farms—
        hand-feeding lambs and caring for any stray creatures that crossed my path.
        At home, I was kept busy with my Labrador, Harley, two cats
        (<strong>Eve</strong> and <strong>Topcat</strong>), and my rabbit,
        <strong>Fluffy</strong>. Each of them showed me that every animal deserves
        a safe, nurturing environment where they can truly thrive.
      </p>

      <!-- Mission & Values -->
      <h2>Our Mission & Values</h2>
      <p>
        At Fur & Away Glasgow, we believe in <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>
        and treating every pet as part of our family. From cosy boarding suites to
        our fun-filled daycare, each service is designed with your pet’s wellbeing in
        mind. We also love giving back: <strong>10% of all our profits go to Scottish
        animal charities</strong>, ensuring that rescue organisations and community
        programmes can continue their vital work.
      </p>

      <!-- Meet the Team -->
      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <p>
        I’m proud to work alongside two passionate pet carers, <strong>Hannah</strong>
        and <strong>Jacob</strong>. Hannah is currently working towards an advanced
        qualification in animal care—she’s always eager to discover new ways to make
        pets feel right at home. Meanwhile, Jacob holds a professional certification
        in canine behaviour and leads our training sessions. Together, we bring a
        wealth of experience, compassion, and energy to ensure your pet’s stay is safe,
        stimulating, and thoroughly enjoyable.
      </p>
